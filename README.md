## This Python code solves a math problem from a Grade 6 textbook. While it could be solved using a diagram, I wanted to write a Python script to solve it for fun and to demonstrate my scripting skills.
## The code has spelling check built into it (in case the user inputs errors) and was debugged using the Notebook debugger. The Notebook cells were combined for easier readability.
